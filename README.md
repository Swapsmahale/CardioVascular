# CardioVascular Risk Prediction System
### Problem Statment
Project using ML algorithms that are used to analyse the risk of heart-related diseases
### Objectives
+ Analyze the Pattern of historical data and extract insights of information.
+ Build a model that predicts the risk of Cardiovascular diseases.
+ Based on analysis spread awareness among the masses about healthy lifestyles and cardiovascular disease.
+ Based on risk try to mitigate and be aware of prevailing health conditions.
### Data
Data was collected from Kaggle in CSV format. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nationâ€™s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviours, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.
